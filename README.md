This is an ubiquitous **Task** (read `todo`) manager app built with:

- [`Next.js`](https://nextjs.org/) for the app interface
- [`Turso`](https://turso.tech/) as the backend database
- [`Jotai`](https://jotai.org/) for atomic state management


This is a hobbyist project to explore different tech in building applications and concepts.
